description: "Partially labeled NeuroPAL volumetric images produced by the Kato lab
  at UCSF as part of an effort to add to the corpus of existing labeled data to facilitate
  the development of automatic cell identification algorithms. We hope that making
  these datasets more easily accessible in a centralized location like DANDI will
  significantly speed up development by allowing new researchers to start working
  on algorithms without the need to build up their own full dataset of training data
  beforehand. \n\nNWB files in this dataset contain the neuroPAL raw images, pre-processed
  images, neuron segmentations and associated manual labels, and additional metadata
  around experimental and imaging conditions.\n\nAs part of this effort, we also propose
  a novel extension to the NWB data format to allow for multichannel volumetric data."
